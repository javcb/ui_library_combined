With Vite as your deployment and development platform, your Best Course of Action for building a premium, feature-rich app is streamlined and efficient. Here’s the updated expert plan:

Best Course of Action (Tailwind Plus + Vite)
1. Use Tailwind Plus as Your Canvas
Base all your app’s pages and layouts on Tailwind Plus kits for high-end design quality and seamless Tailwind CSS integration.

All templates and components work natively with Vite (React+Tailwind workflow is Vite’s sweet spot).

2. Supplement Where Needed With Vite-Compatible Libraries
A. Charts & KPIs
Tremor (https://www.tremor.so/)

Free, beautiful React charting library that works perfectly with Vite and Tailwind.

Add dashboard, KPI, and analytics features rapidly.

Example install:

bash
npm install @tremor/react
Import Tremor charts directly into your Tailwind Plus dashboards.

B. Document/Data/Transaction Management
React-Admin (https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)

Enterprise-level data grid, record management, and file upload modules.

Compatible with Vite—install, configure data source, and wrap in your Tailwind Plus designs.

Example install:

bash
npm install react-admin
For document preview, uploading, tagging—combine React-Admin’s features with your branding.

C. Payments
Stripe React Components (https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react)

Official Stripe library—handles payments, methods, invoice screens.

Drop Stripe’s payment UIs directly into your custom Tailwind Plus layouts.

Plug and play with Vite and React.

D. Messaging & Notifications
Use component libraries like PrimeReact (https://primereact.org/) or React-Toastify

For chat/messaging, notifications, snackbars, modals.

E. Storybook for Documentation & Team Collaboration
Set up Storybook in your repo for component previews, consistency, and UI documentation.

bash
npx storybook@latest init
Storybook works out-of-the-box with Vite for React/Tailwind workflow.

3. Integration Workflow with Vite
Create your main app structure with Vite (npm create vite@latest your-app -- --template react-ts).

Organize your /src directory to include Tailwind Plus pages/components, supplemented modules (charts, payments, admin).

Use React Router for navigation between modules.

Style all third-party components with Tailwind utility-first CSS for visual consistency.

Document and preview with Storybook for rapid experimentation and team review.

4. Alternative: If Feature Depth Is More Important Than Visual Polish
Use TailAdmin Pro or PrimeReact Pro as the main Vite app template.

Reskin it with your Tailwind CSS design tokens for advanced branding.

Add Tremor (for dashboards) and Stripe for payment flows.

Both TailAdmin Pro and PrimeReact work with Vite, offer broader out-of-box modules, and can be themed with Tailwind.
